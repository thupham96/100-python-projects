# Day 4: Rock Paper Scissors Game ‚úäüìÑ‚úÇÔ∏è

Welcome to the **Rock Paper Scissors Game**! This classic hand game is brought to life in Python with a best-of-N rounds format, ASCII graphics, input validation, and real-time score tracking. A fun way to practice game logic and user interaction in a console environment!

## How It Works

1. **Choose Rounds**: Player selects how many rounds to play (Best of N).
2. **Play Turns**: In each round, the player chooses Rock (0), Paper (1), or Scissors (2).
3. **Game Logic**: The computer randomly chooses its move, and the winner of the round is determined.
4. **Track Score**: Scores are updated and displayed after every round.
5. **Decide Winner**: Once all rounds are played, a final winner is declared.
6. **Replay Option**: Player can choose to replay the game.

## Example Run
