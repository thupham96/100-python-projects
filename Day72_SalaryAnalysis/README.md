# Day 72: College Major vs Salary Analysis

This project investigates how undergraduate majors impact salary outcomes across a career. Using a dataset with starting and mid-career salaries, we perform thorough analysis and visualizations to explore trends in salary growth, risk, and earning potential across fields like STEM, Business, and HASS.

## Key Analyses and Insights

### 1. Data Cleaning

* Handled null values and formatted salary columns by removing `$` and `,` for numerical processing.
* Result: Clean, numeric dataset ready for analysis.

---

### 2. Salary Distributions (Histograms)

* Starting Salary Distribution: Most starting salaries cluster around \$40,000–\$60,000.
* Mid-Career Salary Distribution: Broader range, with many professionals earning between \$70,000–\$110,000 by mid-career.

Insight: Salary potential increases significantly over time but with growing disparity.

---

### 3. Salary Growth (%) by Major

* Calculated Growth % = `(Mid-Career - Starting) / Starting * 100`.

Top Growth Majors:

| Major                   | Growth % |
| ----------------------- | -------- |
| Maths                   | 103.52   |
| Philosophy              | 103.51   |
| International Relations | 97.80    |

Insight: Majors like Philosophy and Math show high long-term growth despite modest starting pay.

---

### 4. Salary Spread = Risk Level

* Defined Risk by the spread between 90th and 10th percentile salaries.
* Flagged majors as `High` or `Low` risk based on the median spread.

High Risk (Wide Spread):

* Economics
* Finance
* Maths

Insight: Humanities majors often have wide income variability—higher potential upside but also downside.

---

### 5. Highest & Lowest Salary Percentiles

* Top 90th Percentile (High Reward):

  * Economics: \$210K
  * Finance: \$195K
  * Chemical Engineering: \$194K

* Bottom 10th Percentile (Low Floor):

  * Music, Art History, and Education: \~\$25K–\$30K

Insight: STEM majors dominate the high end; education and social sciences appear more stable but lower earning.

---

### 6. Mid-Career Median Salary (Bar Chart)

![Bar chart showing top 10 mid-career salaries](#)

Top Earners by Mid-Career Median:

* Chemical Engineering
* Computer Engineering
* Electrical Engineering

Insight: Engineering consistently ranks at the top across all salary metrics.

---

### 7. Starting vs Mid-Career Salary (Scatter Plot)

* Positive correlation between starting salary and mid-career earnings.
* Some outliers with low starting but high long-term payoff (e.g., Philosophy).

Insight: A high starting salary often predicts higher lifetime income, but not always.

---

### 8. Salary by Group (Box Plot)

* Compared STEM, Business, and HASS majors.
* STEM: Highest median and narrowest interquartile range.
* HASS: Wider spread, lower medians.

Insight: STEM provides consistent high-paying outcomes, while HASS is more variable.
