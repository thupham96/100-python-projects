# Day 14: Higher or Lower Game

Welcome to the Higher or Lower Game! This Python project is a fun and interactive game that tests your knowledge of popular individuals' social media followings. The challenge is to guess whether the next person has a higher or lower follower count than the current one.

## How It Works

### Game Setup:

- The program provides data for multiple famous individuals, each with their social media follower counts.
- It displays the name, profession, and description of two individuals (Person A and Person B).
- Your task is to determine if Person B has a higher or lower follower count compared to Person A.

### Gameplay:

1. The program shows details for Person A and Person B.
2. You input your guess:
   - Type `'A'` if you think Person A has more followers.
   - Type `'B'` if you think Person B has more followers.
3. The program reveals whether your guess is correct:
   - If correct, your score increases, and Person B becomes the new Person A.
   - If incorrect, the game ends, and your final score is displayed.

### End of Game:

- Your final score is displayed when you make an incorrect guess.
- You can restart the game to try for a higher score!

## Features

- **Fascinating Comparisons**: Learn fun facts about popular individuals and their professions.
