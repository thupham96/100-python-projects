# Day 31: Flash Card App

Welcome to the **Flash Card App**! This engaging and interactive application helps you efficiently learn and memorize new vocabulary using customizable flashcards. Built with an intuitive graphical interface using Tkinter, this tool enhances your language learning experience.

## How It Works

1. **Display Flashcard**: Shows a word or phrase in Vietnamese.
2. **Flip Card**: Reveals the English translation upon user interaction.
3. **Mark as Known**: Allows users to remove known vocabulary from the learning list.
4. **Progress Tracking**: Displays the number of words remaining to learn.

## Example Run

- **Flashcard Display**:
  - The app shows a Vietnamese word (e.g., "Xin chÃ o").
- **Flipping the Card**:
  - User clicks the **Flip** button to reveal the English translation ("Hello").
- **Marking Known Words**:
  - User clicks the **Checkmark** button.
  - Word is removed from the active learning set and progress is updated.
- **Progress Tracking**:
  - The app continuously displays the number of remaining words to master.

## Features

- **Interactive Flashcards**: Smooth transitions between words and translations.
- **Persistent Progress**: Saves progress automatically to continue from where you left off.
- **User-Controlled Learning**: Option to restart or resume previous sessions.
- **Visual Progress Indicator**: Clear tracking of vocabulary mastery.
- **Intuitive GUI**: User-friendly design using Tkinter.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/python-projects.git
   cd Day31_FlashCardApp
   ```
2. Ensure all required files (`card_front.png`, `card_back.png`, `right.png`, `wrong.png`, `flip_button.png`, and vocabulary files) are in the appropriate directories (`images/` and `data/`).
3. Run the application:
   ```bash
