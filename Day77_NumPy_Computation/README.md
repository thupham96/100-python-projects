## Project Features

* Creation of NumPy arrays in various dimensions
* Array slicing, indexing, and reshaping
* Element-wise operations and broadcasting
* Aggregation (sum, mean, max, min, etc.)
* Matrix operations (dot products, transposes)
* Performance comparison with native Python lists

---

## Technologies Used

* Python
* NumPy — for numerical computations
* Jupyter Notebook — for interactive coding and exploration
