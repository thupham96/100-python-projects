# Day 80: Dr. Semmelweis and the Discovery of Handwashing ðŸ§¼ðŸ©º

This project analyzes historical data from Dr. Ignaz Semmelweis's research on handwashing and its impact on maternal mortality in 19th-century hospitals. Using data visualization and statistical techniques, the notebook explores the trends that led to the discovery of hand hygiene as a life-saving practice.

## Key Insights

* Maternal mortality was significantly higher in the clinic staffed by doctors compared to the midwivesâ€™ clinic before handwashing was introduced.
* The introduction of handwashing practices dramatically reduced death rates.
* Data visualization provided crucial evidence to support the importance of hand hygiene in clinical settings.
