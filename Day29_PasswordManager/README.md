# Day 29: Password Manager (Enhanced Version)

Welcome to the **Password Manager**! This secure and user-friendly application helps you store, generate, search, and manage passwords efficiently. It features an intuitive graphical interface built with Tkinter.

## How It Works

1. **Generate Password**: Automatically generates a strong password and copies it to the clipboard.
2. **Add Password**: Saves website credentials (website, email, password) to a data file.
3. **Search Password**: Retrieves stored credentials for a given website.
4. **Delete Password**: Removes stored credentials for a specific website.
5. **Copy Password**: Copies a stored password directly to the clipboard for easy use.

## Example Run

- **User enters** a website and email, then clicks **Generate**:
  - A random password appears in the entry field and is copied to the clipboard.
- **User clicks Add**:
  - Credentials are saved in a `data.txt` file.
- **User clicks Search**:
  - If the website exists, a popup displays the stored credentials.
- **User clicks Delete**:
  - The corresponding website's credentials are removed from the file.
- **User clicks Copy Password**:
  - The saved password for the website is copied to the clipboard.
