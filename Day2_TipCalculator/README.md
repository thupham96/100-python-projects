## How It Works

### Step-by-Step Guide:

1. **Enter Bill Amount**:
   - Provide the total bill amount (e.g., `$120.50`).

2. **Select Tip Percentage**:
   - Enter a custom tip percentage (e.g., `15` or `18.5`).

3. **Number of People Paying**:
   - Specify how many people will split the bill.

4. **Splitting Options**:
   - If one person pays, the total amount (bill + tip) is displayed immediately.
   - For multiple people, you can choose:
     - **Even Split**: The bill and tip are divided equally among all.
     - **Uneven Split**: Each person enters their individual contribution, and tips are distributed proportionally.

### Example Run:
```plaintext
What was the total bill? $100
What percentage tip would you like to give? (e.g., 10, 12.5, 15): 15
How many people are paying? 3
Would you like to split the bill evenly? (yes/no): yes

Final breakdown (even split):
Person 1: Base = $33.33, Tip = $5.00, Total = $38.33
Person 2: Base = $33.33, Tip = $5.00, Total = $38.33
Person 3: Base = $33.33, Tip = $5.00, Total = $38.33
