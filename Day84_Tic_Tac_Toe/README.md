# Day 84: Tic-Tac-Toe â€“ Console Game in Python

This project implements a classic **Tic-Tac-Toe** game that runs in the terminal. Two players take turns marking spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid. The first to align three symbols horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins. If all spaces are filled without a winner, the game ends in a tie.
