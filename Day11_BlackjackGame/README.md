## House Rules

1. **Deck Configuration**:
   - The deck is unlimited in size.
   - No jokers are included.
   - Face cards (Jack, Queen, King) are valued at 10.
   - An Ace can count as either 11 or 1, depending on what benefits the player‚Äôs or dealer‚Äôs hand.

2. **Card List**:
   ```python
   cards = [11, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 10, 10, 10]
   ```
   - All cards have an equal probability of being drawn.
   - Cards are not removed from the deck after being drawn.

3. **Gameplay**:
   - You play against the computer, which acts as the dealer.
   - Your goal is to reach a hand value closer to 21 than the dealer without exceeding 21.
   - The dealer must draw cards until their total is 17 or higher.

## How It Works

### Game Flow:

1. **Initial Deal**:
   - Both the player and the dealer are dealt two cards.
   - One of the dealer‚Äôs cards is hidden until the end of the round.

2. **Player Turn**:
   - You can choose to:
     - Type 'y' to get another card
     - Type 'n' to pass

3. **Dealer Turn**:
   - The dealer will reveal their hidden card.
   - The dealer draws cards until their hand value is at least 17.

4. **Winning Conditions**:
   - You win if:
     - Your hand is closer to 21 than the dealer‚Äôs.
     - The dealer‚Äôs hand exceeds 21 (busts).
   - You lose if:
     - Your hand exceeds 21 (busts).
     - The dealer‚Äôs hand is closer to 21 without busting.

### Example Run:
```plaintext
Do you want to play a game of Blackjack? Type 'y' or 'n': y
Your cards: [7, 3], current score: 10
Computer's first card: 6
Type 'y' to get another card, type 'n' to pass: y
Your cards: [7, 3, 10], current score: 20
Computer's first card: 6
Type 'y' to get another card, type 'n' to pass: n
Your final hand: [7, 3, 10], final score: 20
Computer's final hand: [6, 8, 10], final score: 24
Computer went over 21. You win!
```
