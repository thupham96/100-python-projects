# Day 78: Seaborn & Linear Regression Analysis

This project explores the relationship between movie production budgets and box office revenue using **Seaborn** for visualization and **scikit-learn** for linear regression. The notebook walks through data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and fitting a regression model to understand trends in the film industry.

## Project Features

* Loading and cleaning real-world movie budget and revenue data
* Visualizing data distributions with Seaborn
* Creating scatter plots and regression lines
* Applying linear regression using `scikit-learn`
* Interpreting model results and visualizing fit

---

## Technologies Used

* Python
* Pandas — for data handling
* Matplotlib & Seaborn — for data visualization
* scikit-learn — for linear regression
* Jupyter Notebook — for interactive analysis

## How to Run

1. Clone the repo and navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/thupham96/100-python-projects.git
   cd Day78_Seaborn_LinearRegression
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
   ```

3. Open the notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Seaborn_and_Linear_Regression.ipynb
   ```

## Key Insights

* Visualizing data distributions and relationships helps reveal trends quickly.
* Seaborn's `regplot` simplifies adding regression lines to scatter plots.
* Linear regression can quantify the strength of the relationship between budget and revenue.
* Cleaning real-world data is essential for meaningful analysis.
