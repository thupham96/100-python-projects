# Day 94: Dinosaur Game – Auto-Jump Chrome Clone with Pygame

A Python recreation of the iconic Chrome offline **Dinosaur Game** using the **Pygame** library. The game features a running dinosaur that **automatically jumps over cacti** to avoid collisions. Each successful dodge increases your score. Simple, nostalgic, and addictive!

## Features

* Smooth side-scrolling runner inspired by the Chrome dinosaur game
* **Auto-jump AI** that reacts to nearby cacti
* Obstacles randomly alternate between **small and large cactus types**
* Real-time **collision detection** and game over handling
* Dynamic **score tracking** with live on-screen display
* Clean and responsive **jump physics**
* Polished graphics with animated sprites and parallax background track

---

## Technologies Used

* **Python**
* **Pygame** – for game graphics, animation, events, and sound
* **Object-oriented programming** for clean, modular code structure

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python and Pygame installed.
   If not, install Pygame:

   ```bash
   pip install pygame
   ```

2. Clone the repository or download the files:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/thupham96/100-python-projects.git
   cd Day94_Dinosaur_Game
   ```

3. Run the game:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## How to Play

* The dinosaur will **automatically jump** when a cactus is close.
* Your job is to **observe and enjoy** — it's a hands-free run!
* Watch the **score counter** grow with each cactus avoided.
* If the dinosaur hits a cactus, the game ends after a short delay.

## What I Learned

* Using **Pygame** to manage sprite graphics, collision detection, and event loops
* Implementing **auto-play logic** to simulate AI reflexes
* Managing dynamic obstacles and scoring
* Structuring a game using **object-oriented design** (Dinosaur and Cactus classes)
* Creating a seamless gameplay loop with background, animation, and user feedback
