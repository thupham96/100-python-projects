# Day 28: Pomodoro Timer (GUI Application)

Welcome to the Pomodoro Timer application! This intuitive graphical application implements the Pomodoro Technique, helping you manage your time effectively by alternating work sessions and breaks. It includes interactive functionalities like pause, resume, and reset options, ensuring seamless productivity sessions.

## How It Works

1. Click the **Start** button to initiate a 25-minute work session.
2. After each work session, the application automatically switches to a 5-minute short break.
3. After every four work sessions, a longer 20-minute break is provided.
4. The timer can be paused, resumed, or reset at any point.

## Example Run

- User clicks **Start**:
  - Timer begins countdown (e.g., `25:00`).
- User clicks **Pause**:
  - Timer pauses at the current time.
- User clicks **Resume**:
  - Timer continues from where it paused.
- User clicks **Reset**:
  - Timer resets to `00:00`, session count clears.

## Features

- **Session Management**: Automatically transitions between work, short breaks, and long breaks.
- **Pause/Resume Functionality**: Allows users to pause and resume sessions without losing track.
- **Visual Indicators**: Updates UI labels and checkmarks to visually indicate current session type and completed sessions.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Clearly labeled buttons and a visually appealing interface.
- **Customizable Timing**: Easily adjust session lengths through constants in the script.
